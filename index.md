## About Me

I am a 4rd year Ph.D. student at the University of Central Florida (UCF) studying Computer Vision under Dr. Mubarak Shah. My main focus is in video understanding tasks, with an emphasis on learning useful representations under privacy and fairness constraints. I am currently exploring extending these efforts to video-text multimodal generative models. I recently served as the UCF representative on the student leadership council for the Center for Smart City Streetscapes (CS3) NSF ERC. Feel free to reach out with questions or to discuss research!

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** bias mitigation, privacy preservation, large multimodal models, action recognition, anomaly detection
